* data_cleaner.py: File to clean dataset, convert images all to RGB and same size, and put into a Pandas Data Frame into a pkl file
* pokemon_cnn.ipynb: File to run create and train CNN on the data in the Data Frame
* pokedex.ipynb: Fun way to test out a model trained on the starters. It will also output their Gen One Pokedex description
* model_tester.ipynb: Test out models. The default is the 88 percent trained on 10 Pokemon.
